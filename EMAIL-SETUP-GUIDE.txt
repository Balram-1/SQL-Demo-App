📧 EMAIL VERIFICATION SETUP GUIDE
========================================

To enable REAL email sending, follow these steps:

FOR GMAIL (EASIEST):
====================

Step 1: Enable 2-Factor Authentication
   • Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
   • Turn on 2-Step Verification if not already enabled

Step 2: Generate App Password
   • Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   • Select app: "Mail"
   • Select device: "Windows Computer"
   • Click "Generate"
   • Copy the 16-character password (example: abcd efgh ijkl mnop)

Step 3: Update .env file
   • Open the .env file in this folder
   • Find these lines:
     EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
     EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
   
   • Replace with YOUR details:
     EMAIL_USER=youremail@gmail.com
     EMAIL_PASS=abcdefghijklmnop
   
   • IMPORTANT: Remove all spaces from the app password!
   • Also update EMAIL_FROM:
     EMAIL_FROM=SQLi Demo Store <youremail@gmail.com>

Step 4: Restart the server
   • Stop the current server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
   • Run: node server.js
   • Try signing up with a real email address
   • Check your inbox for the verification code!

FOR OTHER EMAIL PROVIDERS:
==========================

OUTLOOK/HOTMAIL:
   EMAIL_HOST=smtp-mail.outlook.com
   EMAIL_PORT=587
   EMAIL_USER=yourname@outlook.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your-password

YAHOO:
   EMAIL_HOST=smtp.mail.yahoo.com
   EMAIL_PORT=465
   EMAIL_SECURE=true
   EMAIL_USER=yourname@yahoo.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password (generate at https://login.yahoo.com/account/security)

CUSTOM SMTP:
   Ask your email provider for:
   - SMTP host
   - SMTP port
   - Username
   - Password
   - Whether to use SSL/TLS (set EMAIL_SECURE=true if yes)

TROUBLESHOOTING:
================

Problem: Still showing "Email Not Configured"
   → Check that EMAIL_USER is NOT "your-email@gmail.com"
   → Make sure you saved the .env file
   → Restart the server after changing .env

Problem: "Invalid credentials" error
   → Make sure you're using an App Password, not your regular password
   → Remove all spaces from the app password
   → Enable 2FA on your Google account first

Problem: Email not received
   → Check your spam/junk folder
   → Wait 1-2 minutes (sometimes delayed)
   → Try with a different email address
   → Check server terminal for error messages
